  "taxonRemarks": "The name Cerbera lactaria presents some problems in its attribution.  Sprengel (1825) described it as \"Cerbera lactaria Hamilt.\" and cited \"C. Manghas Gaertn.\" in synonymy.  Gaertner's C. Manghas was that of Linnaeus (1753) (indirect reference), so Sprengel's name is illegitimate.  Who was \"Hamilt.\"?  Two possiblities exist: William Hamilton 1783-1856 (abbrev. Ham.) and Francis Buchanan-Hamilton 1762-1829 (abbrev. Buch.-Ham.).  Both have been attributed at one time or another as the source of the name.  The latter was used in Flora of Australia and Index Kewensis and is used here for continuity.  Chapman, APNI 670 (1991) attributed the name as Cerbera lactaria D.Dietrich (1839), claiming that Dietrich obtained his epithet from W.Hamilton. This iteration however is mainly a reprint of Sprengel's work, and also refers back to C. manghas L. via \"C. manghas Gaertn.\" and should be treated as an isonym.  There is no reason to interpret the \"Hamilt.\" of Dietrich any differently to that of Sprengel.",
