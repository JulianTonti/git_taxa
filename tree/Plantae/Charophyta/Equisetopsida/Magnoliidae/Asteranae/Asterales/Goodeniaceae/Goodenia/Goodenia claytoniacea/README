  "taxonRemarks": "The correct spelling and attribution for this species is complicated.  The following was provided by Paul Wilson (pers. comm. 2006):  \"Bentham (1868) used the spelling \"Laytoniana\", taken from a Mueller specimen label.  Mueller (1882) in his Census adopted the spelling \"claytoniacea\" with a reference to Bentham but without an explanation. This latter spelling was also adopted by Mueller in his Second Census (1889) and by Gardner (1931) in his Enum. Pl. Austral. Occ. where he correctly attributed the name to Mueller (1882) and gave G. Laytoniana as a synonym thus making Mueller's name illegitimate.  Carolin (1990) adopted the spelling \"claytoniacea\" and explained that Bentham's spelling was an orthographic error.  Chapman (1991), APNI: 1443,  did not accept the name G. claytoniacea F.Muell. and stated that it is \"an orthographic variant or an erroneous spelling of \"laytoniana\".  Leigh Sage has examined the type and has confirmed that Bentham misinterpreted Mueller's handwriting.\" Three solutions are possible: 1. a case could be made to conserve the spelling claytoniacea against laytoniana; 2.  accept Bentham's original spelling, with G. claytoniacea in synonymy as an illegitimate name; or 3. accept that Bentham made an inadvertent orthographic error in spelling because he couldn't read Mueller's handwriting, and this was subsequently corrected without comment by Mueller.  The third is the simplest solution and preserves current usage, as per Carolin (1990, 1992).  It is adopted here.",
